## Reporting a Vulnerability

If anyone comes across this and finds a vulnerability, then feel free to fork the project, fix the problem, and submit a pull request.

I make no assurances I will respond to anything in a timely manner, but when I find the time to return to this, I will.

Thanks in advance!
